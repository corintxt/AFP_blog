    "Goal:\n",
    "* To produce an [alluvial diagram](https://flourish.studio/blog/animating-sankey-visualisations/) showing inputs from donors, pass-through organizatinos in the middle, and spending items at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data structure:\n",
    "* Data should always be in *long format*. Columns labelled `source` and `target` indicate flow; for a multi-stage chart, columns labelled `Step from` and `Step to` indicate the stage.\n",

    "So our data should roughly look like:\n",

    "| Save America  | Legal fees  | $45 | 2 | 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Another option is to use [Mike Bostock's Sankey chart component](https://observablehq.com/d/56c49c88e84b5de5) on Observable. This might be better for getting a clean and customizable SVG.\n",

    "* How much money have Trump-affiliated entities (not including super PAC) raised this cycle?\n",
    "* How is this money transferred between entities?\n",
    "* How much of the money is spent on legal fees?\n",
    "* What are the other main spending categories?\n",
    "\n",
